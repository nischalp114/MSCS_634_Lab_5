# Wine Clustering Lab

## Purpose
This lab explores Hierarchical and DBSCAN clustering using the Wine dataset. It demonstrates data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and evaluation metrics for comparison.

## Key Insights
- Hierarchical clustering revealed structured subgroupings within the dataset and was visualized using a dendrogram.
- DBSCAN identified noise points effectively and allowed for density-based clustering.
- Evaluation showed strengths and weaknesses in both methods using silhouette, homogeneity, and completeness scores.

## Challenges
- Tuning DBSCAN parameters required experimentation.
- Visualizing high-dimensional data with reduced features was necessary to make plots interpretable.
